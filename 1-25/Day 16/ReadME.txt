Day 16: OOP principles : 

For Day 16, the project extends the previous Coffee Machine Simulator into a more modular and refined version by utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It incorporates classes like Menu, MenuItem, CoffeeMaker, and MoneyMachine to encapsulate functionalities.

Key Concepts:

Class Structure:
Menu Class: Manages the available drinks and retrieves details about them.
MenuItem Class: Represents individual drink items with specific ingredients and costs.
CoffeeMaker Class: Handles the coffee-making process, including checking resource sufficiency and updating resources after each order.
MoneyMachine Class: Processes payments, calculates coins inserted, and ensures enough money is provided.

Features:

Improved Code Modularity:
The code is split into smaller, more focused classes. This makes the logic cleaner, easier to maintain, and reusable.

Enhanced User Flow:
Users can select drinks from a refined menu.
The program verifies if there are sufficient resources to make the requested drink, processes the payment, and updates the machine's resource levels.

The main concept of Day 16's project was to dive deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), emphasizing how to structure and organize code for better maintainability, reusability, and clarity.

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Highlighted:

Encapsulation:
Each class (Menu, MenuItem, CoffeeMaker, and MoneyMachine) encapsulates specific functionality. This means all related data and behavior are bundled into distinct objects, hiding the internal workings from the outside world and exposing only what’s necessary (e.g., methods like is_resource_sufficient and make_payment).

Abstraction:
The complexity of processes like handling payments, checking resource availability, and making coffee is abstracted away into easy-to-understand methods within each class. For example, MoneyMachine.make_payment() handles all the coin input and payment processing, so the main logic doesn’t need to worry about the details.

Modularity:
By breaking the program into separate classes, the code becomes more modular. Each class has its specific role, making the code easier to manage, test, and debug. For instance, changes to the coffee-making logic can be handled within the CoffeeMaker class without affecting how the payment system works in MoneyMachine.

Reusability:
The OOP structure encourages reusability. If you wanted to build a similar machine or expand its functionality (e.g., add more drinks), you wouldn’t need to rewrite all the logic from scratch. You can extend or reuse existing classes and methods. For example, adding a new drink would only require adding it to the Menu class.
