Day 15 : Coffee Machine CODE :

For Day 15, the project revolves around building a Coffee Machine Simulator. This interactive program allows users to "buy" coffee by inserting coins and selecting their desired drink. The project involves several components:

Key Features:

Menu Options:
The program presents three drink options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino, each with distinct ingredients and costs.

Resource Management:
The coffee machine starts with a set amount of water, milk, and coffee beans.
Each time a drink is made, the machine checks if there are sufficient resources available. If not, it informs the user of the deficiency.

Coin Processing:
The program simulates coin insertion by prompting the user to input the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
It calculates whether the inserted amount is enough to cover the cost of the selected drink.
If the amount exceeds the required cost, the program returns the change to the user.

Transaction Flow:
If sufficient resources and payment are available, the drink is prepared, and the resources are deducted from the machineâ€™s supply.
The machine keeps track of the total money it collects from transactions.

Administrative Commands:
Users can turn the machine off by typing "off" or check the remaining resources by typing "report."
This project reinforces concepts such as modular code structure, user input handling, condition checks, loops, and resource management, providing an engaging and real-world-like simulation of a coffee vending machine.
