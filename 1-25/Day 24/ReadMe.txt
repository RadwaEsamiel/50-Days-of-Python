Day 24 : Automated Letter Generator :

The Automated Letter Generator is a Python project that simplifies the process of creating personalized letters for multiple recipients. By utilizing a template letter and a list of names, the program generates individual letters tailored for each person. This project demonstrates how to handle file input and output, string manipulation, and basic automation to streamline repetitive tasks.


Key Features
Template Letter: The program reads a template letter from a text file. This letter contains a placeholder for the recipient's name, which allows for easy personalization.

Dynamic Name Insertion: It reads a list of names from a separate text file and replaces the placeholder in the template letter with each name, creating a customized letter for every individual.

Output Management: The generated letters are saved in a designated output folder, with each file named according to the recipient. This organization makes it easy to manage and distribute the letters.


Through the development of this project, I gained the following insights and skills:

File Handling in Python: learned how to efficiently read from and write to text files, including managing file paths and ensuring proper file formatting.

String Manipulation: The project reinforced my understanding of string operations, including replacement of placeholders and trimming whitespace from user input.

Organizing Output: structuring output files in a clear and logical manner, making it easier to access and share generated letters.
