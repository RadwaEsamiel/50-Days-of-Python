Day 23 : The Turtle Crossing Game : 

The Turtle Crossing Game is a Python-based project that simulates a simplified version of the classic "Frogger" game, where the player controls a turtle trying to cross a road filled with moving cars. The goal is to reach the top of the screen while avoiding collisions with the cars, which increase in speed with each successful crossing. The game is built using Python’s turtle module, and it includes player movement, dynamically generated cars, and a scoring system that tracks the player’s progress.

Key Features
Player Control: The player controls a turtle that moves up the screen. Each time the player reaches the top (finish line), they return to the starting position and the level increases, making the game progressively more challenging.

Car Movement: Cars are randomly generated and move horizontally across the screen. The speed of the cars increases with each level, providing a dynamic challenge for the player.

Collision Detection: The game detects when the turtle collides with a car. If the turtle is too close to a car, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.

Scoring System: The scoreboard tracks the player's progress by displaying the current level. Each time the player reaches the finish line, they level up, and the cars speed up accordingly.

Structure
The project is divided into several components, each represented by a class that handles specific parts of the game:

Player Class: Manages the turtle's movement and tracks whether the turtle has reached the finish line. It allows the player to move the turtle upward using keyboard inputs.

CarManager Class: Responsible for generating, moving, and removing cars from the screen. It manages the cars' speed and increases the difficulty by speeding up the cars after each successful level.

Scoreboard Class: Tracks the player's progress and displays the current level on the screen. It also handles the display of the "Game Over" message when the player collides with a car.


Conclusion
The Turtle Crossing Game is a fun and interactive project that blends basic game development principles with Python programming. It not only helped me enhance my skills in Python and object-oriented programming but also introduced me to game logic, such as player movement, collision detection, and level progression.
