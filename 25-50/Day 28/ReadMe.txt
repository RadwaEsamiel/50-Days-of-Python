Day 28: Pomodoro Timer
This project involves building a Pomodoro Timer using the Tkinter library in Python. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The goal of this project was to create a visual timer that helps users follow the Pomodoro method with a countdown mechanism and notifications for work and break sessions.

Learning Objectives and Key Concepts:
GUI Development with Tkinter: This project reinforced my knowledge of Tkinter, the built-in Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. I learned how to create and manipulate various widgets such as buttons, labels, and canvases, as well as how to apply custom styles (colors, fonts, etc.) to make the interface user-friendly.

State Management and Event Handling: A key feature of this project is state management, as the timer alternates between work and break periods. I used event handling to implement start and reset functions for the timer, updating the label text and colors dynamically based on the current state (work, short break, or long break).

Countdown Mechanism: The core of the application is the countdown function, which recursively calls itself every second until the timer reaches zero. This process helps simulate the Pomodoro technique by triggering work and break intervals in sequence.

Repetition Tracking: The project uses a repetition counter to keep track of the intervals (referred to as rep). Every set of work and break sessions is marked by a check mark, which visually shows how many Pomodoro cycles the user has completed. This required careful logic to ensure that after every two sessions, a check mark was displayed.

Time Management Functions: I utilized mathematical functions like math.floor() to calculate minutes and seconds from the total number of seconds in a given interval, ensuring that the timer displays in the correct format (MM
).


This project was a great practical exercise in combining time management techniques with GUI development, while also demonstrating how to handle real-time updates in Python applications.
