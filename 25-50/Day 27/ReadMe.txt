Day 27 : Miles to Kilometers Converter : 

This project involves creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that converts distances from miles to kilometers. The application is built using the Python Tkinter library, allowing for easy interaction with users through a window where they can input values and receive instant feedback.

Learning Objectives and Key Concepts:
GUI Design with Tkinter: The primary objective of this project was to get hands-on experience with building a GUI application using Tkinter. By using basic widgets like labels, buttons, and input fields, I was able to construct an intuitive user interface that enables users to perform quick conversions.

Widget Placement with Grid Layout: Tkinter's grid() method was used to organize the elements (widgets) in a grid layout, which allowed for a clean and structured arrangement of components. This project reinforced the importance of layout management for building visually appealing interfaces.

User Input and Output Handling: The Entry widget was used to take user input (the number of miles), and the output (in kilometers) was displayed using a Label widget. The program processes the user input, performs the miles-to-kilometers conversion, and updates the result dynamically within the interface.

Basic Conversion Logic: The conversion formula for miles to kilometers is simple but important:

1 mile = 1.609 kilometers. This project helped reinforce basic mathematical operations in Python while demonstrating how to integrate such logic into a real-world application.
Button Click Event Handling: I implemented an action that gets triggered when the user clicks the "Calculate" button. This click event is linked to a function that retrieves the input, processes it, and updates the output label with the converted value.
