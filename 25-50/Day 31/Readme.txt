Day 31 : Flashcard Application :

This project is a Flashcard Application designed to help users learn Arabic vocabulary through an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python's tkinter library. The application randomly presents Arabic words alongside their English translations, allowing users to test their knowledge and reinforce their learning.

Key Features:

Dynamic Vocabulary Learning:
Users can learn Arabic words from a CSV file. If the user has previously learned words, the application will use this data to continue their learning journey. If the file is not found, the app loads a default set of Arabic words.

Flashcard Interface:
The application displays flashcards with Arabic words. Users can see the Arabic word and, after a set duration, the English translation. This flip feature helps in retaining vocabulary by associating the foreign language with its translation.

User Interaction:
Users can indicate their understanding of the word by pressing buttons for "Correct" or "Incorrect." The application tracks user performance, maintaining a score that updates dynamically as users interact with the flashcards.

Progress Tracking:
The application keeps track of the user's score and the number of attempts, providing feedback on their learning progress.

Data Persistence:
Usersâ€™ progress is saved into a CSV file, allowing them to continue from where they left off during their next session.
